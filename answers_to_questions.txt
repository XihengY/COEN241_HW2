3. What is the command to invoke the slack-interactive function?

4. What is the output you see when you invoke the slack-interactive function?

{"text": "Serverless Message", "attachments": [{"fields": [{"short": true, "value": "100", "title": "Amazing Level"}], "author_icon": "", "image_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/XihengY", "author_name": "xihengyang", "title": "The Awesome world of Cloud Computing!

5. How would you pass different arguments to the functions?

I would invoke the slack-interactive function with json string like '{"Hello":"COEN241"}'. And the slack-request function does not need arguements. 


6. How would you change the slack-interactive function to react to different inputs?

I would change the strings of different keys to the values in the response dictionary. 
For example, change 
  "author_link": "https://github.com/XihengY/COEN241_HW2",
to
  "author_link": response['author_link'],
 Therefore, when I input '{"author_link":"hello"}', the output should be '{"author_link":"hello"}'.
